# Installation
The program is written in Python, using the matplotlib library to generate the plot and PyQT6 to create the GUI. For ease of use the program is packaged into a single executable file, using PyInstaller. To run the program, download the SimpleGraph V1.0.0.exe file and run it. The program is currently only available for Windows, but can be run on other operating systems by installing Python and running the code directly. Avast antivirus specifically may flag the program as a virus, this is a false positive.

### Windows
To install the program on Windows, download the SimpleGraph V1.0.0.exe file and run it. 

### Other Operating Systems
To install the program on other operating systems, install Python and run the code directly. The program requires the following libraries to be installed:
- matplotlib
- PyQt6

To install these libraries, run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install PyQt6
```

# Usage
The program is designed to be as simple as possible to use. The user can manually enter data and the program will generate the plot. The user can then save the plot as an image file. The program also allows the user to change some plotting settings to adjust the plot to their liking. The program is designed to be used in a laboratory setting, where the user may want to quickly plot some data to verify it, or to create a publication ready plot. The program is not designed to be a replacement for more advanced plotting software, such as Origin or Matlab or wokring directly in Python.
