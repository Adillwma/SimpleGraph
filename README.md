To run the program, download the SimpleGraph V1.0.0.exe file and run it.
Avast antivirus specifically may flag the program as a virus, this is a false positive. The program is safe to run.

The program is written in Python, using the matplotlib library to generate the plot and PyQT6 to create the GUI.

ENJOY!
